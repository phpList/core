; have to make sure that you run the queue from the commandline
; check README.commandline how to do this
MANUALLY_PROCESS_QUEUE = true;

; batch processing
; if you are on a shared host, it will probably be appreciated if you don't send
; out loads of emails in one go. To do this, you can configure batch processing.
; Please note, the following two values can be overridden by your ISP by using
; a server wide configuration. So if you notice these values to be different
; in reality, that may be the case

; max messages to process
; if there are multiple messages in the queue, set a maximum to work on
MAX_PROCESS_MESSAGE = 999;

; define the amount of emails you want to send per period. If 0, batch processing
; is disabled and messages are sent out as fast as possible

MAILQUEUE_BATCH_PERIOD = 3600;

; to avoid overloading the server that sends your email, you can add a little delay
; between messages that will spread the load of sending
; you will need to find a good value for your own server
; value is in seconds, and you can use fractions, eg '0.5' is half a second
; (or you can play with the autothrottle below)
MAILQUEUE_THROTTLE = 0;

; Mailqueue autothrottle. This will try to automatically change the delay
; between messages to make sure that the MAILQUEUE_BATCH_SIZE (above) is spread evently over
; MAILQUEUE_BATCH_PERIOD, instead of firing the Batch in the first few minutes of the period

; Domain Throttling
; You can activate domain throttling, by setting USE_DOMAIN_THROTTLE to true
; define the maximum amount of emails you want to allow sending to any domain and the number
; of seconds for that amount. This will make sure you don't send too many emails to one domain
; which may cause blacklisting. Particularly the big ones are tricky about this.
; it may cause a dramatic increase in the amount of time to send a message, depending on how
; many users you have that have the same domain (eg hotmail.com)
; if too many failures for throttling occur, the send process will automatically add an extra
; delay to try to improve that. The example sends 1 message every 2 minutes.

; if you have very large numbers of users on the same domains, this may result in the need
; to run processqueue many times, when you use domain throttling. You can also tell phplist
; to simply delay a bit between messages to increase the number of messages sent per queue run
; if you want to use that set this to true, otherwise simply run the queue many times. A cron

DOMAIN_AUTO_THROTTLE = false;

; MAX_PROCESSQUEUE_TIME
; to limit the time, regardless of batch processing or other throttling of a single run of 'processqueue'
; you can set the MAX_PROCESSQUEUE_TIME in seconds

; this allows multiple installations each to run the queue, but slow installations (eg with large emails)
; set to 0 to disable this feature.

; Time Zone
; By default phpList will operate in the Timezone of your server. If you want to work
; in a different Timezone, you can set that here. It will need to be a valid setting for
; both PHP and Mysql. The value should be a city in the world
; to find PHP timezones, check out http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
; You will also need to tell Mysql about your timezones, which means you have to load the timezone
; data in the Mysql Database, which you can find out about here:
; http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-tzinfo-to-sql.html
; make sure that the value you use works for both PHP and Mysql. If you find strange discrepancies
; in the dates and times used in phpList, you probably used the wrong value.

; list exclude will add the option to send a message to users who are on a list

; message queue prepare
; this option will handle the sending of the queue a little bit differently
; it assumes running the queue many times in small batches
; the first run will find all subscribers that need to receive a campaign and mark them all
; as 'todo' in the database. Subsequent calls will then work through the 'todo' list and
; send them. This can be useful if the SQL query to find subscribers for a campaign is slow
; which is the case when your database is filling up.

; admin authentication module.
; to validate the login for an administrator, you can define your own authentication module
; this is not finished yet, so don't use it unless you're happy to play around with it
; if you have modules to contribute, open a tracker issue at http://mantis.phplist.com
; the default module is phplist_auth.inc, which you can find in the 'auth' subdirectory of the
; admin directory. It will tell you the functions that need to be defined for phplist to
; retrieve it's information.
; phplist will look for a file in that directory, or you can enter the full path to the file

; eg
ADMIN_AUTH_MODULE = "phplist_auth.inc";
; or
; ADMIN_AUTH_MODULE = "/usr/local/etc/auth.inc";

; stacked attribute selection
; this is a new method of making a selection of attributes to send your messages to
; to start with, it doesn't seem to work very well in Internet Explorer, but it works fine
; using Mozilla, Firefox, Opera (haven't tried any other browsers)
; so if you use IE, you may not want to try this.

; stacked attribute selection allows you to continuously add a selection of attributes
; to your message. This is quite a bit more powerful than the old method, but it can also
; cause very complex queries to be constructed that may take too long to calculate
; If you want to try this, set the value to 1, and give us feedback on how it's going

; if you want to use dates for attribute selections, you need to use this one


; this functionality has been dropped from the core phpList system, but will be added
; using plugin functionality.

; Public protocol
; phpList will automatically use the protocol you run the admin interface on for clicktrack links and

; advanced bounce processing
; with advanced bounce handling you are able to define regular expressions that match bounces and the
; action that needs to be taken when an expression matches. This will improve getting rid of bad emails in
; your system, which will be a good thing for making sure you are not being blacklisted by other
; mail systems
; if you use this, you will need to teach your system regularly about patterns in new bounces
